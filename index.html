<p>In the opening night of the 2016 U.S. Olympic Team Trials for Swimming, Elizabeth Beisel finished second in the 400-meter individual medley behind Maya DiRado. Beisel, 23, earned a silver medal in the event at the London 2012 Olympic Games. Working toward the Rio Games, she pulled muscles in her leg in January 2015 and struggled to come back.</p>

<p>“I can't tell you how emotional today was for me!” she said after the race. “Just so many nerves and doubts over the past year having the injuries and stuff like that, it's hard to block it out, but it's such a relief, such a relief.”</p>

<p>She also competed in the 2008 Games in Beijing. Back then, she was the youngest on the U.S. Olympic Swimming Team. Now, age 23, she is one of the older Team USA swimmers going to Rio.</p>

<p>Also racing the first night of trials, Conor Dwyer, 27, finished second in the 400 freestyle and said, “I don't like losing, but I will take a bid to Rio” (assuming at that point that all second-place finishers would be named to the team).</p>

<p>He followed it up with another second place in the 200 freestyle, giving him a berth in that event in Rio as well as a spot on the men’s 4x200 freestyle team.</p>
